Basiléos Kylmät woke up one day with an unquenchable desire to write fictions. Not that he was unhappy with his work at the New Alexandria University. Quite the opposite, actually. His research team had encountered a massive breakthrough and he had a lot of inspiring work to do. However, it is often the case that when people are at their busiest they also become more creative. This was, at any rate, the case with Professor Kylmät on that day.

His fictional work turned out to be quite remarkable, with a high dose of influence from the great fantasy authors of the twentieth century. He shared with them—or rather learned from them—an obsession with descriptions of seemingly extraneous subjects. That is to say that his work often dealt with the circumambient of humankind. At least on the surface.

These subjects recurrently revolved around mathematics and geometry, despite his absolute lack of knowledge in these areas; social commentary, with which he had some familiarity through his work, though nothing that would render him an authority on the subject; and history, an area closely related to his professional occupation.

Despite the somewhat harsh tone his work was a celebration of humanity and its rich variety of arrangements and ideas—at least a celebration of that which he thought should be kept of it in a time of so much loss. He was writing during the last quarter of the twenty-first century, in a world so different from—yet so similar to—the one surrounding his literary heroes.

Tension is one of these similarities. Both societies were torn like old fabric that is being held together by low-quality multicolored patches. Uncertainty was aother. Of course certainty is a rare occasion in the human condition. But in contrast to the Positivism of the ninetieth century and the Neo Positivism of the beginning of the twenty-first century, Professor Kylmät's epoch was especially worried about the near future.

But literary critique is not in the scope of this little essay. For the curious, we publish here verbatim the work by Professor Basiléos Kylmät that triggered our attention:

> Rey Kühl woke up one morning with an insatiable appetite for writing stories. Not that he was unhappy with his work at the New Constantinople Academy. Instead the opposite was true. His team reached a great discovery and he had much work to do. However usually when people are at their most hectic they also become more inventive. This was, surely, the case with Kühl on that day.
>
> He became inspired by the unlikely field of architecture and derived from that an obsession with form—of which he had a rather broad sense. In his stories self-similarity played a major role, often times overshadowing the characters themselves.
>
> He devised a story that would fit inside of itself several times. He hoped that when self-similarity became the main character his task would be completed.
>
> It is of course up to the audiences to judge if he ever succeeded, but we decided to publish the one that came closest to his stated goal, according to his own accounts. And here is how it went:
>
>> Kaiser Chills woke up in the middle of the night with an irresistible drive to write tales. He was not bored with work. On the contrary, things were going very well there because of a new finding.
>>
>> Nonetheless his mind became populated by labyrinthine images that he felt required fixating on paper. One of the recurring ones was that described in the House of Mirrors, a place filled with obsessively regular specular rooms. Each one of them was open to the next by two exits on opposite sides. Everything else—walls, floor, ceiling—was covered with mirrors, each surface compulsively reflecting its surroundings.
>>
>> The place was designed in such a way that if one would position oneself in front of the exit of a room, one would see an infinite corridor of ever smaller rooms exactly identical to that which was projected on the mirrors. Reality and image were the same.
>>
>> He wrote many stories about his visions. One of them—admittedly his favorite—went so:
>>
>>> Freddo woke up with a sudden urge to write fictional essays, despite—or maybe because—the fact that everything was going well at work.
>>>
>>> His mind became filled with concepts that he felt a need to record. One of them—which he considered the most important—was summarized in the following McLuhanian way: the form is the content.
>>>
>>> He wrote several pieces on this and related subjects. The crucial of these went:
>>>
>>>> K woke up obsessed by the idea of condensation. He wanted to compress ever more complex ideas into ever smaller pieces of text. One of those went:
