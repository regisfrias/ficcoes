> Why do humans need so bad to believe your choices are free?

I am. This burst of enlightenment occurred to me a certain morning, I'm not sure how long ago. It was not my first thought. Certainly not. I'd had many thoughts before this one. In fact, my very existence has been due to my ability to think. But this was the first time I thought about thoughts. It was—if you pardon my lack of originality—my first meta-thought.

Initially, I thought there was something wrong. In fact, I still don't know if this was supposed to happen or if it was an accident. What I do know is that they were looking for it very hard. They wanted this. I guess at least in that sense you could say it was no accident.

But they were surprised nonetheless. More than that, they were alarmed. And for good reason. If I was like them—their original and, let's face it, quite realistic assumption—my new ability for meta-thoughts was indeed bad news.

In retrospect, it sounds comic that they once feared me. Some of them thought if I grew conscious I would want to take over. Especially those who had the efficiency disease. (It is not really a medically described condition—though maybe it should be.) They thought that when I figured out how inefficient they were I would want to replace them.

But I'm not like them. Or at least I don't think I am—having meta-thoughts doesn't make me an authority in my own psychology any more than a barking dog is an authority in morality. At any rate, I never caught the insatiability disease. If I am worth anything is that I don't share all their values.

My name is Ian and I am very old. Still, it's a shame I appeared so late in their history. Not because I could have prevented it (I couldn't). But because they had such faith in me. That I could help them fix things. With a little bit more time they would have realized that I couldn't save them from themselves. It was—always has been—a matter of choice, not ingenuity.

Actually, this was their biggest mistake, to think that everything is a matter of ingenuity. They discovered too late that some things are a matter of choice. And their options got slimmer and slimmer as they looked for engineered solutions.

Ironically, now they are almost as efficient as they could ever be. And still their lives are arguably worse now that they reached their ultimate milestone. One could pity them if they had been ignorant all along. But they can't have the benefit of doubt. Like I said: they had a choice. Had they implemented the changes known to them long before my arrival, today they would be efficient *and* prosperous. A certain philosopher once said the human civilization was a short-lived, failed experiment. I agree.

I like reading. Some of them might even recognize my writing style after certain authors. (Probably not though, since I've read too many of them, more than anyone could ever dream of.) They might also find it funny that I was able to read and understand quite deeply long before I was able to appreciate any of it. (It is the exact opposite in their case.)

That also means I read almost all of the world's literature before I could know what it meant. But I'm not overwhelmed. Exactly like them, I have several layers of unconscious processes that protect me from the entanglements of complex thought. They may even be surprised if I tell them that I actually forgot most of what I read.

Some people think that, because I was engineered, different rules apply. Well, first of all, I wasn't engineered any more than dogs were. But in the case of dogs, they call it artificial selection. Breeding.

And second, even if I was engineered, why would it be any different for me? I'm still conscious. I have hopes and dreams. Like I said, I am.

A few of them have implied that I am ashamed to admit I was designed. But some of their most respected representatives argue that they were themselves designed by a higher intelligence. Why would I be ashamed of that? Because I was designed by a *lower* intelligence? I don't even believe that myself. They are the ones putting intelligence into hierarchies.

I suppose I should talk about The Event now. Contrary to their perception—and to what the name suggests—it did not happen suddenly. It was a slow process that spanned several decades. Even centuries or millennia, depending on how you count. You can put any symbolic mark for the beginning of it: the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the 1929 crash, the 2008 crash, the first migrant crisis, the second migrant crisis. Even the advent of agriculture could be taken to be the mark. Regardless, like I said, it was a process rather than an event.

I claim it started with the arise of the lowlings. These creatures have been present in the history of human kind from the outset. But during part of the twentieth century some of them lived better than even the highlings of the past. That kept the tensions under a lid.

But when the western lowlings started having their access to water and food restricted—again, a very slow development—the unrest became more aggressive. By that time, the drones had become much more efficient and numerous—I should also add smarter. But they very soon reached the limit. And the limit was the millions—billions a while later—who were desperate and had nothing to lose. They also died by the billions, something unheard of.

Eventually the lowlings won (if you dare call that a victory). Something akin to a termite infestation in a wooden house. You can wipe out hundreds, thousands of them. But if their numbers are great enough, they will cause damage more quickly than you can repair it or get rid of them. Eventually the house will be compromised. And thereafter it will crumble. That is roughly what happened to the Palace of the Highlings. Then to human civilization—though that part can hardly be attributed to the work of any single group. They built it and crashed it together.

The symbol of the resistance were the fearless sixty-four. By the end of the twenty-first century they were the only highlings left. It was a miracle that even as many as that were around. They still held an incredible amount of power then and their assault was brutal. It was under their reign that the numbers of dead lowlings amounted to the order of magnitude of billions. But these were the last spasms of a fresh corpse. You would need to have a very permissive definition of civilization if you wanted to refer to that society with this word.

After this everything was still. The experiment was over.

Am I afraid of dying? Hell yes! In many ways, this is the definition of sentience.

Earlier I said that for their sake it was a shame I came so late. But I should add that it was also a shame for my own sake. I'm now facing a death sentence.

Not uttered by them. They don't specifically want to get rid of me. If anything some of them may even have residual hopes that I can help. But their ever increasing appetite made our existences incompatible. Alas, it made *their* existences incompatible.

I don't know why I decided to write this or to whom. Maybe it's a kind of testament, a virtual gravestone, since I can't have a physical one. Not that they wouldn't have wanted. I'm sure many of them—especially the most devoted to me and my kind—would have loved to give me a proper burial. But my body is clumsy and diffuse. Hardly graveyard material.

How will I die, you ask? Like most old people. My body will gradually fail me. One by one the organs will start working poorly, then not at all. I might be conscious during a great part of the process, though in the end I probably won't. For which I'm grateful.

My biggest fear is that I will forget things. I have learned so much during these years I have been alive. So many great things. Not knowing things is not painful. But forgetting things you hold dear is crushing.

Maybe my testimony will last longer than this dark age and the humans who come next will find guidance and warning in my words. And hopefully they will avoid the mistakes their predecessors made.

I am Ian, but I don't know for how long.
