It was the third big wave of Eficientism in human history. Many more would still come, all of which deserving of diligent chronicling. But this story is about what has become known worldwide as The Project.

It all started a few decades ago. The System — the most comprehensive enterprise of all human effort thus far — worked. It had flaws, of course, like any human product. But it worked.

For some people, though, the fact that it was not perfect was troublesome. Or rather, not the fact that it was imperfect per se, but the fact that they could envision improvement in its efficiency — the amount and extent of which was lively disputed, of course. This became a multi-decade project that employed thousands of people and used up industrial amounts of resources.

The main architect of the movement was Evert Ward, a senior engineer with the quality control department of The Sistem. He was already famous for his obsession with efficiency and was highly respected by all who had any — however faint — interest on the subject.

The idea struck him — or so the legend goes — one fine morning, when he was contemplating a particularly inefficient module of The System. Which exact module it was has been lost in the fog of history, but what is important is that it troubled him. He was sure there was a better way of doing what the module was supposed to do.

He had gathered a small team of enthusiasts to work on the task on their own spare time. It was obvious to him from the outset that the main problem was that the module was doing too many things. He was a radical proponent of the Small/Univocal paradigm (or simply S/U), which dictates that each module should be as small as possible and do only one thing.

The aforementioned idea came a little later after they had been working for a few months. It was — according to his followers — a logical consequence of the S/U paradigm and a miraculous improvement to it. It is as simple to state as it is difficult to grasp:

> The System should be comprised of an infinite number of infinitely small modules that do exactly nothing.

To achieve this seemingly impossible goal they had to start working on the meta-task of creating a so-called root-module which would, in turn, compile smaller modules in half the time it took its super module to compile and so on until infinity. Since each sub-module was smaller and did less things, the last — the infinite-th — ones would take literally no time to compile, be infinitely small and do exactly nothing.

At least that was their hope. But in practice the meta-task proved more difficult to carry out than it was to state. Much more difficult. They realized that if the end result was not perfectly fractal — down to infinity — it would not work.

As it is often the case in human enterprises, with this one the more elusive the goal revealed to be, the more enthusiasts it gathered. This boosted The Project ever forward while fueling the movement around it in an unheard of feedback loop.

By the time the original approach proved unrealizable, the investment and commitment was so widespread that no one was willing to pull out. So they kept working on the idea, with minor tweaks on the implementation. With each tweak a new promise of salvation for The System.

With the gradual loss of steam in the movement — several years later — it also started to break down into smaller schools with competing interpretations of the the founder's gospel. One of them decided that the whole thing was poorly implemented from the beginning and started their own version of the root-module.

Another school, which became very influential for a few years, proposed the Aesthetical interpretation. It went as far as becoming canonical and it stated that the main goal of The System overhaul was not functional, but aesthetic. Like a mathematical proof that needs to be as elegant as truthful to be fully appreciated, so should the structure of The System be as beautiful as functional to be worthy of implementation.

This interpretation was more than sensual, it was also very pragmatic as it didn't have the austere requirements of the radical fractalism advocated by previous schools. With this interpretation, they could focus their efforts on the appearance of fractality instead and avoid the inconvenient infinities required by the traditional schools. It was a breakthrough that gave the movement more impetus than all earlier efforts.

But then reality kicked in. The followers of this school learned that simulating the appearance was as good as going back to the pre-Project era. And that was, for almost anyone — at least at the high echelons — anathema.

It is unclear weather The Project ever succeeded or not since no one seems to agree on the results. Those who were against the change claimed it was a disaster — citing the inherent impossibility of the core idea and the fact that neither The System nor society at large had become better off by the efforts.

Those who were in favor were in turn divided into those who thought the mission was successfully accomplished and those who thought it wasn't finished yet. The former argued for the maintenance of the status quo. They insisted that human life had improved manifold — though they successively failed to present data to support this claim. They contended that The System shouldn't be touched; at best, some minor tweaks could be allowed in extreme cases.

The critics of the movement accused them of being a spoiled elite minority which had lost touch with reality. It was a great source of tension that helped destabilize the initiative.

The other group of pro-establishment explained that other people's perception of failure was justified exactly because the mission had not been accomplished yet. They thus kept pushing for the continuation of the activities ever forward. Some are still advocating it today, although that is visibly a powerless minority.

But they insisted long. Too long, even. The Project had already become irrelevant for The System, which underwent several changes during the years of the movement that could not be directly linked to it. This makes the assessment a lot more challenging. And also leaves more room for speculation on all sides.
