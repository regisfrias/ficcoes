I still remember quite vividly the first time I saw The Timekeeper. I was about seven and my father told me it was finally time for me to watch this extraordinary monument to modernity with my own eyes. I was so thrilled with anticipation the night before that it felt like I would not be able to sleep — though I eventually was and had dreams about it.

On the way there on the next morning my father explained — with his characteristic didactic — that the construction was both a symbol and an engine of our time.

On the one hand, its sober beauty testifies our good taste and moderation. He told me that, despite the appearance of complexity, every part of the machine is there for a reason. The overall look derives rigorously from the role each part plays.

On the other hand, its perfectly working inner structure is able to show such scales as a single quantum of time or the age of the Universe. For reasons I would take several years to understand, it is important that the time is kept with precision and consistency.

It feels as if all this happened a few days ago, but the fact is that now is the time for me to take my children there and explain what my father did. I don't know if I can do as good a job, but I will do my best. I suppose the most important thing is to spark their curiosity so that they can learn more by themselves.

In short, I will tell them that The Timekeeper is the most important human fabrication of all time — no pun intended — both in its engineering mastery and its philosophical conception. The mechanical intricacies, of course, have a better chance of capturing their imagination. Children especially love the fractal structure and the fact that the parts get smaller and smaller at each level. They will get caught up in dreams when I tell them that the smallest pieces are invisible even to the most powerful microscope.

They will also — like I did — drop their chins in awe when they see the Main Wheel, this gigantic crystal circle with thousands of smaller ones rotating around their parents and around themselves, semi-independently.

The journey is itself filled with wonder. That is because you cannot see this massive structure from close by. It has a radius of two kilometers and it lies parallel to the ground where it was built. So I will take my children to the center of the wheel, where we can take the elevator to the viewing deck. On the way there we will travel below the structure, where we will be able to see the smaller wheels.

It is a breathtaking ballet of colors and sounds. The material is almost completely transparent, but it reflects sparkles of multicolored light in a seemingly random fashion. In a particularly bright day you can actually see the fractal pattern of ever smaller circles.

When we get to the center we can take the elevator. It is a half an hour, three kilometer upward trip in which every second is magical.

But the philosophical purpose of the enterprise should be stated with the same passion and seriousness as its engineering wonders. All activities in our society are timed. It is no exageration to say that time is the substrate upon which the existence of our civilization rests. So much so that it is speculated that the existence of The Timekeeper precedes our own. This is further evidenced by the complete absence of a beginning in its known history — that is not the case for us, since we love our own history.

Speculations apart, what is crucial is that time is key. I don't expect my children to understand all the philosophical consequences of this, but at least they should know that we work for more than aesthetic fulfilment.

All of this — I will tell them – does not mean The Timekeeper is perfect, by all means. For it to be ever more precise we need to build ever smaller wheels. For the better measurement of large-scale time spans we need an ever slower main wheel. And for all that we need new theories, technologies and tools. Many are engaged in this never ending job. And many more are needed.

The Timekeeper is a work in progress, something we improve every day and have been doing so for generations. Every small improvement as well as every new breakthrough makes it work better — sometimes marginally, sometimes by leaps. And, in one way or another, everyone is involved in the work. So will my children be. This is why it is so important that they become interested at an early age. They will be the future builders and maintainers of the greatest work of humankind. Hopefully for yet generations to come.
