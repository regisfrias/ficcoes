In an old and now almost forgotten chapter of the human history there was a tribe known as The Wanters. They were very peculiar in their ways: they always expected their peers to take their wants into consideration above everything else. Hence the name.

When the first anthropologists arrived at this tribe — in what was known as the first expedition —, they didn't take long to understand this odd behavior, which they referred to as a severe case of entitlement. It turns out that, for an inexplicable concentration of luck, they were indeed provided with whatever they wanted by their environment. After learning their language, Uruguayan anthropologist Dr. Gustavo Moledor noticed that every time one of them wished for something they received it in the form of what any other human would call an accident.

For example, in one occasion, a certain tribe member felt hungry and wished for cooked duck. Two minutes later a duck who was flying above the village had a stroke and fell one meter in front of him. No one but Dr. Moledor seemed to be surprised, which was for him even more surprising.

At first, Dr. Moledor thought this was an extreme coincidence, but he then started to see this happen again and again. Every time someone wished for something, that something was realized almost immediately afterwards.

When Dr. Moledor's reports started arriving at the metropolis, other scientists had their curiosity triggered. Mathematician Island Meadow was the first to arrive with a crew of doctoral students and other enthusiasts. They carefully gathered all data they could from these events and analyzed them diligently over a period of twenty-five years — they themselves bearers of unusual luck for research funds.

Their conclusion was that whatever was causing the wishes to be realized, the data now pointed to a slow decay. The plotted numbers from the studied period seemed to draw a section of a bell curve in the beginning of its second half.

Meadow's team hypothesized that the events had become more and more frequent over the previous one hundred years or so. The growth followed a bell curve, which had peaked around the time the mathematicians arrived there. If this was the case, it meant that the current generation of Wanters had lived most of their lives in this era of unimaginably abundant luck.

This luck, although incredibly rare is nevertheless mathematically possible. The Wanters themselves did not give any supernatural explanation to the coincidences. They believed that this is how reality behaves. For them this was as much a law of nature as gravity or thermodynamics.

The problem was that, if the mathematicians' hypothesis was correct, this unusual coincidence of coincidences — which they called metacoincidence — was going to end in fifty to one hundred years.

The anthropologists triggered warnings that, if this was the case, their society was on the verge of a collapse: it is one thing to gradually start having all your wishes fulfilled; but another thing entirely when the trend goes the other way. Their idea was that in the preceding two generations The Wanters easily learned to get what they wanted, but for the coming two generations to unlearn that could prove challenging.

Indeed, after about fifty years of the first expedition, the rate of granted wishes was roughly half of what it had been. This triggered social unrest that this society had never experienced.

They initially blamed the researchers for interfering in the society with their queer measurements and eccentric observations. At a certain point — about sixty years after the arrival of the first expedition — the tribe dwellers became aggressive and some researchers were even killed. The remaining ones decided to leave to save their lives and the data gathering began to shrink.

The Wanters' perception about the data, though, did not. Clearly they didn't have their wishes granted as they knew their parents' and grandparents' had. So, without the external scapegoats, they started accusing each other. Their main accusation was that others were overwishing. They argued that the tribe had a limited amount of wishes that could be granted by nature and they were exceeding it. They also claimed that their parents only wished what they truly needed — though this could not be verified against data after the scientists had been banned. But anyone would agree that this generation had ever pettier wishes, and this, they sustained, was crowding the system and deterring legitimate wishes to be granted.

This also gave rise to a period of increased religiosity. Shamans entered the picture explaining that the gods had been responsible for the provisions all along, but they had been quiet as long as The Wanters behaved well. But now they became upset at them for their immoral behavior.

Thus, new moral laws were imposed on people, who were then submitted to all sorts of arbitrary practices and rituals — some of them quite harsh — targeted at pleasing the gods. As the divinities' humors didn't show signs of improvement, new sects sprouted everywhere with conflicting interpretations of the phenomena.

This sparked a new wave of violence which killed about ten percent of the population — which had already been reduced to about forty percent of what it was at the time of the first expedition, due to deprivation of resources.

After around one hundred years of Dr. Moledor's arrival at the tribe of The Wanters, the metropolis was receiving no news whatsoever from that part of the world and no one dared to go there and risk being killed. It is possible that the tribe was able to adapt to the vanishing metacoincidence and started living as their predecessors presumably did — that is, not counting on luck to survive. But it has been speculated that they simply perished and humanity will never hear from them again. Since the researchers at the time were only focused on the extraordinary facts, no one payed attention to the mundane knowledge produced by The Wanters. And that will now have been lost forever.
