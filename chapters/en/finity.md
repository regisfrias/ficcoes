The Finity Age began with the last number. This is not a manner of speech, the last number is indeed literally the last number. Up until the second half of the 21st century, humans believed numbers extended into infinity. It is understandable. Of course! Whichever number you can think of, it's easy to add one to it and you get a bigger number. Add one to that one and you get an even bigger one. Repeat the process indefinitely and you can do this forever, each number bigger than the previous. You would never reach the end.

The problem with this thinking is that it is abstract. You can also argue that matter can be divided indefinitely and you can always find a smaller piece. Except that at some point you do reach the bottom, the smallest piece.

They assumed that, because mathematics was abstract, pure, you could extend your reasoning as long as you want. But they found that nature always puts a limit. To everything.

And so too it happened with the so-called natural numbers. They were, for a very long time, believed to be endless. But an end was found for them.

The idea was first proposed by John Creek, a very successful and respected mathematician in the 2060s. He began by taking it seriously the idea that nobody had actually counted all the numbers until infinity. This thought, albeit puerile, turned out to be very fruitful.

Until the first half of the 21st century, humankind had a very limited computing power. But after the finding of the meta-analog computers there was a boom in scientific and mathematical discoveries. They had — it was thought — unlimited computing power. This allowed them to start trying out ideas previously thought to be silly. But now there were no limits — notice the irony — to how many ideas they could test.

And test they did.

The last number is — you will have guessed it — large. There is no hope of trying to convey it here. Finding that number took almost all of the world's computational power. It was a joint effort between several research institutes and universities, which combined machine and human power in a one of a kind cooperation project.

So much so that the number itself became irrelevant. They learned such a great deal about working together that a new era of the human history ushered in. The discovery of Finity gave people a feeling of humbleness and awe toward nature. The obsession with infinity was superseded by the search for balance.

Some have dived into other areas with the goal of finding other limits to things previously thought to be infinite. Mathematicians started looking for the last digit of irrational numbers, the smallest interval between two numbers, the last prime number. Astronomers started looking for the end of the Universe, the end of the Multiverse.

A new Renaissance began as musicians started to write pieces at an astonishing rate, hoping to compose all of the world's conceivable music within their lifetimes. Other artists did the same. With the help of the smartest computers they created more than humanity had created until then. This prompted other researchers to search for better ways to find what people wanted, so the library sciences developed incredibly during that time.

The search for immortality — whose main exponent was the Brain State Upload (BSU) – was declared charlatanism. It was from then on referred to as the Second Age of Alchemy. People who had been, until a few decades earlier, searching for the philosopher's stone of an endless life were struck by the realization that everything — really everything — has an end.
